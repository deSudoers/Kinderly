### Technologies for the elderly
##### Platform to connect the elders in society with the youth for HackHarvard Global 2018-19.


## Problem

In this day and age, the elderly population is large and growing due to advancements in the area of health care. These
people are faced with numerous physical, psychological and social role changes that challenge their sense of self and
capacity to live happily. One of the most prominent challenges that they face is loneliness and depression, either as a
result of living alone or due to lack of close family ties.

## Solution
To counter this widespread problem of loneliness among the elderly, we came up with an idea that connects the
younger generation with the older generation in a way that benefits both of them.
We have designed a platform called Kinderly which connects younger people who are searching for houses to live in
with the elderly who are willing to allow them to live with them. People can sign up on our app and become as paying
guests in the houses of elderly.
